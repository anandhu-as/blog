Everyone, at some point in life, experiences the pain of losing someone important. The emotional journey that follows is often described through the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Denial is the first and most difficult stage, where we struggle to accept the loss, often living in the past and refusing to believe the person is gone. Then comes anger—anger toward the person who left us, toward ourselves, or even toward life itself. In breakups, especially when we feel responsible, regret often turns into frustration and emotional pain. Bargaining follows, filled with thoughts like “what if I had done this differently?” or “what if I reach out again?”—as we desperately try to reverse the outcome. Depression is the stage where the reality hits hardest, and we feel mentally and emotionally drained, often needing distractions like new hobbies to cope. Finally, we reach acceptance—not because the pain is gone, but because we learn to live with it. We understand that the person we lost isn’t coming back, and we begin to focus on healing and living a better life. These stages don’t always come in order, and people may experience them differently, but grief is something every human goes through, and with time, we grow through it.

My journey with greif
In my journey, just like the stages of grief describe, I struggled deeply to accept the loss of someone important to me. For a long time—almost five to six months—I couldn’t truly come to terms with the fact that they were gone. I lived in denial, holding onto memories and hoping that somehow things would go back to the way they were.

During that time, I tried to distract myself by doing new things, always keeping myself busy so I wouldn’t have to face the pain directly. Whether it was picking up a new hobby or throwing myself into work, I was doing whatever I could to avoid sitting still with my thoughts.

When I entered the anger stage, I found that my frustration wasn’t just directed at the situation—it was aimed at myself. I was angry for being the way I am, blaming myself for things I couldn’t control. Regret and self-doubt consumed me, and it was a really painful and confusing time.

Eventually, I moved into a space where I could begin to reflect and feel the weight of the loss more clearly. It wasn't easy, but over time I started to heal. I still carry the pain with me, but now it feels lighter. I've come to understand that grief doesn’t disappear—it changes, and we grow through it. I’ve learned to live with the absence, and I continue trying to build a better version of myself, one step at a time.
